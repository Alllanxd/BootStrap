                            <p> From the title my name is Allan and I was raised in Australia. I graduated from UNSW with a
                                Bachelors
                                in Commerce (Majors in Finance and Accounting) in 2016. Ever since then I have been working in
                                various companies in the Accounting department.
                            </p>
                            <p> When I joined my previous company as an junior
                                accountant, I realised that there were so many changes I could make to their Excel sheets which were
                                outdated and everyone had to manually enter in everything. I spent a few lunchbreaks fixing up all
                                that which could be automated through VBA and generic Excel code. It was when I realised that
                                figuring out how to code and debug things kept me my sanity and after which I decided to look
                                towards Computer Science or Software/Web development as a future career.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I currently still work full time as an Accountant however I'm hoping that after this bootcamp I can
                                start building my portfolio through freelancing or through creating my own projects. After I have a
                                solid portfolio, I'll look into trying to obtain internships or seeing if I can get a full time job
                                within a coding related field.
