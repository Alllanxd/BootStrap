# bootstrap page

## what is this repository? 

It's a place for me to practice how to code and see what I can achieve with the knowledge that I obtain. Coding requires commitment and with the limited amount of time I actually have to spend on it, I want to see what I can do and each commit is like completing a little milestone. 

## The past and the future

I haven't coded before so there wouldn't be any past projects however I'm looking to increase as I go along. Right now my knowledge is divided between html, css and now bootstrap. This is what I can create so far and hope that once I have a bit more time I can make my coding a bit more efficient and aesthetic. 

## What made me start coding 

To be honest it was just a break out from my boring routine within an accounting industry. Accounting requires number crunching but web development and coding requires logic, problem solving and at times creativity. It's possible for me to create a new future out of this through coding but this will require some time and a lot of motivation/will power to do so. Pushing myself to the limit would cause me to burn out so I'm just taking my time really learning the fundamentals instead of forcing myself to jump straight into a new career. 

## What were my challenges

This is all really new to me so being able to understand the syntax of things and how to position/style were the hardest things to go through. The only solution to this is practice but coding, to me, feels like a complex little world since there are always different ways of writing code and there will always be problems no matter how good your solution may be. 

## What is see in the future

Hopefully being able to build my own apps, creating a portfolio that will take me somewhere new. Accounting is a very static industry with rules and regulations restricting you geographically however software/web development just requires you to be able to code and be good at it. This way there could be opportunities to work in a different country and experience a different lifestyle instead of being stuck in Australia.
